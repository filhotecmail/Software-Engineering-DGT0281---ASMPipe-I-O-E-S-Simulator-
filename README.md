# Software-Engineering-DGT0281---ASMPipe-I-O-E-S-Simulator-
ASMPipe I/O is a low-level, programmable I/O pipe simulator implemented in x86 Assembly. This project demonstrates fundamental operating system concepts by emulating a communication pipe between two simulated processes. It features a circular buffer for data storage and custom routines for reading from and writing to the pipe, showcasing direct memory management and simple synchronization primitives. The core focus of this project is on programmable I/O, where all data transfer logic is manually implemented at the bare-metal level, without relying on high-level system calls or an existing operating system kernel.
